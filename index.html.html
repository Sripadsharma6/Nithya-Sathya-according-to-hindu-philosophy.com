<h1><b><i><center><hr>Sathya or the truth</hr></center></i></b></h1>
<center>The truth remains itself, nor can it be changed nor evolved.It is the <b>kaarana</b>(reason) but not <b>doshi</b>(guilty).As <b><i>Shri SHANKARAACHARYA</i></b> 
says ,the <b>sa guna</b>(shaped brahman) or the <b>nirguna</b>(shapeless)<i> brahman is the water and the crop we grow gives the result.<i>it is <b>nithya</b> or in other words, permanent and never dies.<br><h3><b><i>ADVAITHA SIDHAANTHA(THE PHILOSOPHY OF NON DUALISM)</i></b></h3>
<br><b><i><h4>Non dualism</h4></i></b><br>

The supreme Bramha thathva(the philosophy of which is <b>truth, real, Nithya</b>(ever present) and the soul of all beings) is un understandable to all. Many Maharshis'(the great sages') came up with different methods to realizing Bramhan(bhakti, jnana, karma, raaja yoga) and introduced the Chathurvidha purushaarthas which are dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), kama (desire) and moksha (liberation from maaya).Maharshis' like Aadi Shankara bhagavathpaada achaarya(commonly known as Aadi Shankaraachaarya), Veda Vyaasa, Gouthama, Agasthya, Maarkandeya, Madhvaachaarya, Shree Vidyaaranya mahaswami, Shree shree Chandrashekhara bharathee mahaswami, shree shree Bhaarathi Theertha mahaswami, Shree shree Vidhushekhara Bharathi mahaswami, Shree Raamakrishna paramahamsa, vivekananda, Shree Krishna (in the form of guru), Shree venkataachala avadhootha, Shree Shreedhara swami e.t.c.)

The Advaitha Sidhaantha states that there is one eternal thing in everything. The person who realizes the bramhan is called a jeevanmuktha-the one liberated(from maaya) while still in maaya(the body)-due to his will.

Nithaanithya vasthu viveka(nithya(Eternal, Constant)-anithya(not Eternal or Constant)vasthu(object(s'))viveka(knowledge)) states that the knowledge of what is eternal and not is the philosophy of Nithaanithya vasthu viveka.The Brahman is real and eternal and the rest is maaya. Maaya is neither eternal or constant.If Brahman is eternal, reality, omniscient, bliss etc then eternal, reality, omniscient, bliss etc is Brahman.So may you call it with different names, it REMAINS THE SAME AS IT IS.

<br>My prostrations to all maha rishis who contributed their lives for the uplifment of the world.

<br>thank you
